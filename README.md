# Smart-Hybrid-Fan-Heater-
Designed & Implemented a Smart Hybrid Fan Heater as FYP, in which I along with my team members
developed its Human Machine Interface (HMI), Andriod based App using IOT platform, electrical control
circuity and additional safety features. Made its convection fan drive circuitry, control circuitry of gas valve
assembly, temperature control circuitry for both room & flaming chamber, over heat protection circuit and flame failure circuit and integrated them all with Arduino Mega.
